## 📄 Documentation

The documentation is available [here](https://doc.ticket.pm/)

## ⚠️ Incompatibility
This new source code you're seeing are completely refactored and will be incompatible with the older version.
I recommend you finish up all of your remaining support ticket and start migrating to the newer version.
If you prefer to stay in the older version, you can download anything that is less than `3.0.0` from the release
or clone from the `old` branch (i.e. `git clone -b old https://github.com/Sayrix/Ticket-Bot.git`)
